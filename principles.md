Project Principles
==========

* We will not tackle Big Data (even considering a watered-down definition of same).
* We will incorporate strengths of participants wherever possible.
* We will embrace and explore and represent uncertainty, ambiguity, and imprecision.
* We want to incorporate locative information, bounded in such a way as to be broad and  interesting and manageable
